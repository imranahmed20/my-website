                <h3>What Rust Brings to Frontend and Web Development</h3>
                <p>Rust offers a safer, more secure language that's robust enough for application development. Here's what can it do for the frontend and web.</p>
                <p>The year 2022 may well have been the year of Rust, with its introduction into the Linux Kernel. But should frontend/web developers concern themselves with this popular language in 2023?</p>

                    What Is HTML? Hypertext Markup Language Basics Explained
                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. </p>

                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language</p>

                <h2>About HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as andirectly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as  surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

                <h2>Devolopment</h2>
                <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>

            <h3>What’s Rust’s Role in Frontend?</h3>
            <p>“Rust to WebAssembly is one of the most mature paths because there’s a lot of overlap between the communities,” Gardner told The New Stack. “A lot of people are interested in both Rust and WebAssembly at the same time.”</p>
            <p>It’s not an either “Rust or JavaScript” or even “WebAssembly or JavaScript” situation, he said. It’s possible to blend WebAssembly with JavaScript.</p>
            <p>“You’re going to see some people rewrite for WebAssembly, but you’re going to see some people take advantage of WebAssembly where appropriate, and then use JavaScript for connecting the various pieces under the hood, and maybe running portions of the application as necessary,” he said.</p>
