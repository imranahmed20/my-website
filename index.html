                <h3>What Rust Brings to Frontend and Web Development</h3>
                <p>Rust offers a safer, more secure language that's robust enough for application development. Here's what can it do for the frontend and web.</p>
                <p>The year 2022 may well have been the year of Rust, with its introduction into the Linux Kernel. But should frontend/web developers concern themselves with this popular language in 2023?</p>

            <h3>What’s Rust’s Role in Frontend?</h3>
            <p>“Rust to WebAssembly is one of the most mature paths because there’s a lot of overlap between the communities,” Gardner told The New Stack. “A lot of people are interested in both Rust and WebAssembly at the same time.”</p>
            <p>It’s not an either “Rust or JavaScript” or even “WebAssembly or JavaScript” situation, he said. It’s possible to blend WebAssembly with JavaScript.</p>
            <p>“You’re going to see some people rewrite for WebAssembly, but you’re going to see some people take advantage of WebAssembly where appropriate, and then use JavaScript for connecting the various pieces under the hood, and maybe running portions of the application as necessary,” he said.</p>
